2. Get a specific hero using GET and the route /heroes/:id
- if the hero is not found return the following: 
{   "error": "Hero not found" }, status:404
3. Get the powers currently in the databse
using GET through the route /powers
4. Get a specific power using GET and the route powers/:id
- if the power does not exist, return the following:
{
  "error": "Power not found"
}
5. Update a power's description currently in the database using PATCH through the route /powers/:id
- if the update is successful return the power in the following format: 
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "super strength",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
and the appropriate status code

- if the power does not exist return the following:
{
  "error": "Power not found"
} and the appropriate status code.

- if the uodate fails due to vlaidation errros return the following:
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
} and the appropriate status code

6. Create a new HeroPower that is associated with an existing hero and power through the POST method and /hero_powers route.It should accept an object with the following properties in the request body:
{
  "strength": "Average",
  "power_id": 1,
  "hero_id": 3
